-- 1b) Ensure the role can connect to the target database
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO app_user;

-- 2) give it access only to your app schema
GRANT USAGE, CREATE ON SCHEMA laravel TO app_user;

GRANT USAGE, SELECT, UPDATE ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA laravel TO app_user;

-- 4) ensure future tables/sequences get the same grants
-- If objects are created by postgres (or your CI admin role), grant app_user rights by default
